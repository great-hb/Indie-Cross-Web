class NetStream
package openfl.net
extends EventDispatcher
Available on all platforms

The NetStream class opens a one-way streaming channel over a NetConnection. Use the NetStream class to do the following:

Call NetStream.play() to play a media file from a local disk, a web server, or Flash Media Server.
Call NetStream.publish() to publish a video, audio, and data stream to Flash Media Server.
Call NetStream.send() to send data messages to all subscribed clients.
Call NetStream.send() to add metadata to a live stream.
Call NetStream.appendBytes() to pass ByteArray data into the NetStream.
Note:You cannot play and publish a stream over the same NetStream object.

Adobe AIR and Flash Player 9.0.115.0 and later versions support files derived from the standard MPEG-4 container format. These files include F4V, MP4, M4A, MOV, MP4V, 3GP, and 3G2 if they contain H.264 video, HEAAC v2 encoded audio, or both. H.264 delivers higher quality video at lower bit rates when compared to the same encoding profile in Sorenson or On2. AAC is a standard audio format defined in the MPEG-4 video standard. HE-AAC v2 is an extension of AAC that uses Spectral Band Replication (SBR) and Parametric Stereo (PS) techniques to increase coding efficiency at low bit rates.

For information about supported codecs and file formats, see the following:

FLV/F4V open specification documents
Receiving data from a Flash Media Server stream, progressive F4V file, or progressive FLV file

Flash Media Server, F4V files, and FLV files can send event objects containing data at specific data points during streaming or playback. You can handle data from a stream or FLV file during playback in two ways:

Associate a client property with an event handler to receive the data object. Use the NetStream.client property to assign an object to call specific data handling functions. The object assigned to the NetStream.client property can listen for the following data points: onCuePoint(), onImageData(), onMetaData(), onPlayStatus(), onSeekPoint(), onTextData(), and onXMPData(). Write procedures within those functions to handle the data object returned from the stream during playback. See the NetStream.client property for more information.

Associate a client property with a subclass of the NetStream class, then write an event handler to receive the data object. NetStream is a sealed class, which means that properties or methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at runtime. However, you can create a subclass of NetStream and define your event handler in the subclass. You can also make the subclass dynamic and add the event handler to an instance of the subclass.

Wait to receive a NetGroup.Neighbor.Connect event before you use the object replication, direct routing, or posting APIs.

Note: To send data through an audio file, like an mp3 file, use the Sound class to associate the audio file with a Sound object. Then, use the Sound.id3 property to read metadata from the sound file.

Events:

asyncError	
Dispatched when an exception is thrown asynchronously נthat is, from native asynchronous code. This event is dispatched when a server calls a method on the client that is not defined.

drmAuthenticate	
Dispatched when a NetStream object tries to play a digital rights management (DRM) encrypted content that requires a user credential for authentication before playing. Use the setDRMAuthenticationCredentials() method of the NetStream object to authenticate the user. If user authentication failed, the application retries authentication and dispatches a new DRMAuthenticateEvent event for the NetStream object.

drmError	
Dispatched when a NetStream object, trying to play a digital rights management (DRM) encrypted file, encounters a DRM-related error. For example, a DRMErrorEvent object is dispatched when the user authorization fails. This may be because the user has not purchased the rights to view the content or because the content provider does not support the viewing application.

drmStatus	
Dispatched when the digital rights management (DRM) encrypted content begins playing (when the user is authenticated and authorized to play the content). DRMStatusEvent object contains information related to the voucher, such as whether the content is available offline or when the voucher expires and users can no longer view the content.

ioError	
Dispatched when an input or output error occurs that causes a network operation to fail.

mediaTypeData	
Dispatched when playing video content and certain type of messages are processed. A NetDataEvent is dispatched for the following messages:

onCuePoint
onImageData
onMetaData
onPlayStatus (for code NetStream.Play.Complete)
onTextData
onXMPData
Note: This event is not dispatched by content running in Flash Player in the browser on Android or Blackberry Tablet OS or by content running in AIR on iOS.

netStatus	
Dispatched when a NetStream object is reporting its status or error condition. The netStatus event contains an info property, which is an information object that contains specific information about the event, such as if a connection attempt succeeded or failed.

onCuePoint	
Establishes a listener to respond when an embedded cue point is reached while playing a video file. You can use the listener to trigger actions in your code when the video reaches a specific cue point, which lets you synchronize other actions in your application with video playback events. For information about video file formats supported by Flash Media Server, see the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en" scope="external">www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en.

onCuePoint is actually a property of the NetStream.client object. IThe property is listed in the Events section because it responds to a data event, either when streaming media using Flash Media Server or during FLV file playback. For more information, see the NetStream class description. You cannot use the addEventListener() method, or any other EventDispatcher methods, to listen for, or process onCuePoint as an event. Define a callback function and attach it to one of the following objects:

The object that the client property of a NetStream instance references.
An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream is a sealed class, which means that properties or methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at runtime. Create a subclass of NetStream and define your event handler in the subclass. You can also make the subclass dynamic and add the event handler function to an instance of the subclass.
The associated event listener is triggered after a call to the NetStream.play() method, but before the video playhead has advanced.

You can embed the following types of cue points in a video file:

A navigation cue point specifies a keyframe within the video file and the cue point's time property corresponds to that exact keyframe. Navigation cue points are often used as bookmarks or entry points to let users navigate through the video file.
An event cue point specifies a time. The time may or may not correspond to a specific keyframe. An event cue point usually represents a time in the video when something happens that could be used to trigger other application events.
The onCuePoint event object has the following properties:

Property	Description
name	The name given to the cue point when it was embedded in the video file.
parameters	An associative array of name and value pair strings specified for this cue point. Any valid string can be used for the parameter name or value.
time	The time in seconds at which the cue point occurred in the video file during playback.
type	The type of cue point that was reached, either navigation or event.
You can define cue points in a video file when you first encode the file, or when you import a video clip in the Flash authoring tool by using the Video Import wizard.

The onMetaData event also retrieves information about the cue points in a video file. However the onMetaData event gets information about all of the cue points before the video begins playing. The onCuePoint event receives information about a single cue point at the time specified for that cue point during playback.

Generally, to have your code respond to a specific cue point at the time it occurs, use the onCuePoint event to trigger some action in your code.

You can use the list of cue points provided to the onMetaData event to let the user start playing the video at predefined points along the video stream. Pass the value of the cue point's time property to the NetStream.seek() method to play the video from that cue point.

onDRMContentData	
Establishes a listener to respond when AIR extracts DRM content metadata embedded in a media file. A DRMContentData object contains the information needed to obtain a voucher required to play a DRM-protected media file. Use the DRMManager class to download the voucher with this information.

onDRMContentData is a property of the NetStream.client object. This property is listed in the Events section because it responds to a data event when preloading embedded data from a local media file. For more information, see the NetStream class description. You cannot use the addEventListener() method, or any other EventDispatcher methods, to listen for, or process onDRMContentData as an event. Rather, you must define a single callback function and attach it directly to one of the following objects:

The object that the client property of a NetStream instance references.
An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream is a sealed class, which means that properties or methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at runtime. However, you can create a subclass of NetStream and define your event handler in the subclass or make the subclass dynamic and add the event handler function to an instance of the subclass.
onImageData	
Establishes a listener to respond when Flash Player receives image data as a byte array embedded in a media file that is playing. The image data can produce either JPEG, PNG, or GIF content. Use the openfl.display.Loader.loadBytes() method to load the byte array into a display object. onImageData is actually a property of the NetStream.client object. The property is listed in the Events section because it responds to a data event, either when streaming media using Flash Media Server or during FLV file playback. For more information, see the NetStream class description. You cannot use the addEventListener() method, or any other EventDispatcher methods, to listen for, or process onImageData as an event. Define a single callback function and attach it to one of the following objects:

The object that the client property of a NetStream instance references.
An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream is a sealed class, which means that properties or methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at runtime. Create a subclass of NetStream and define your event handler in the subclass. You can also make the subclass dynamic and add the event handler function to an instance of the subclass.
The associated event listener is triggered after a call to the NetStream.play() method, but before the video playhead has advanced.

The onImageData event object contains the image data as a byte array sent through an AMF0 data channel.

onMetaData	
Establishes a listener to respond when Flash Player receives descriptive information embedded in the video being played. For information about video file formats supported by Flash Media Server, see the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en" scope="external">www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en.

onMetaData is actually a property of the NetStream.client object. The property is listed in the Events section because it responds to a data event, either when streaming media using Flash Media Server or during FLV file playback. For more information, see the NetStream class description and the NetStream.client property. You cannot use the addEventListener() method, or any other EventDispatcher methods, to listen for or process onMetaData as an event. Define a single callback function and attach it to one of the following objects:

The object that the client property of a NetStream instance references.
An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream is a sealed class, which means that properties or methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at runtime. You can create a subclass of NetStream and define your event handler in the subclass. You can also make the subclass dynamic and add the event handler function to an instance of the subclass.
The Flash Video Exporter utility (version 1.1 or later) embeds a video's duration, creation date, data rates, and other information into the video file itself. Different video encoders embed different sets of meta data.

The associated event listener is triggered after a call to the NetStream.play() method, but before the video playhead has advanced.

In many cases, the duration value embedded in stream metadata approximates the actual duration but is not exact. In other words, it does not always match the value of the NetStream.time property when the playhead is at the end of the video stream.

The event object passed to the onMetaData event handler contains one property for each piece of data.

onPlayStatus	
Establishes a listener to respond when a NetStream object has completely played a stream. The associated event object provides information in addition to what's returned by the netStatus event. You can use this property to trigger actions in your code when a NetStream object has switched from one stream to another stream in a playlist (as indicated by the information object NetStream.Play.Switch) or when a NetStream object has played to the end (as indicated by the information object NetStream.Play.Complete). onPlayStaus is actually a property of the NetStream.client object. The property is listed in the Events section because it responds to a data event, either when streaming media using Flash Media Server or during FLV file playback. For more information, see the NetStream class description. You cannot use the addEventListener() method, or any other EventDispatcher methods, to listen for, or process onPlayStatus as an event. Define a callback function and attach it to one of the following objects:

The object that the client property of a NetStream instance references.
An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream is a sealed class, which means that properties or methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at runtime. Create a subclass of NetStream and define your event handler in the subclass. You can also make the subclass dynamic and add the event handler function to an instance of the subclass.
This event can return an information object with the following properties:

Code property	Level property	Meaning
NetStream.Play.Switch	"status"	The subscriber is switching from one stream to another in a playlist.
NetStream.Play.Complete	"status"	Playback has completed.
NetStream.Play.TransitionComplete	"status"	The subscriber is switching to a new stream as a result of stream bit-rate switching
onSeekPoint	
Called synchronously from appendBytes() when the append bytes parser encounters a point that it believes is a seekable point (for example, a video key frame). Use this event to construct a seek point table. The byteCount corresponds to the byteCount at the first byte of the parseable message for that seek point, and is reset to zero as described above. To seek, at the event NetStream.Seek.Notify, find the bytes that start at a seekable point and call appendBytes(bytes). If the bytes argument is a ByteArray consisting of bytes starting at the seekable point, the video plays at that seek point. Note: Calls to appendBytes() from within this callback are ignored.

The onSeekPoint property is a property of the NetStream.client object. The property is listed in the Events section because it responds to data coming into the appendBytes() method. For more information, see the NetStream class description and the NetStream.client property. You cannot use the addEventListener() method, or any other EventDispatcher methods, to listen for or process onSeekPoint as an event. To use onSeekPoint, define a callback function and attach it to one of the following objects:

The object that the client property of a NetStream instance references.
An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream is a sealed class, which means that properties or methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at runtime. However, you can create a subclass of NetStream and define your event handler in the subclass. You can also make the subclass dynamic and add the event handler function to an instance of the subclass.
onTextData	
Establishes a listener to respond when Flash Player receives text data embedded in a media file that is playing. The text data is in UTF-8 format and can contain information about formatting based on the 3GP timed text specification. onTextData is actually a property of the NetStream.client object. The property is listed in the Events section because it responds to a data event, either when streaming media using Flash Media Server or during FLV file playback. For more information, see the NetStream class description. You cannot use the addEventListener() method, or any other EventDispatcher methods, to listen for, or process onTextData as an event. Define a callback function and attach it to one of the following objects:

The object that the client property of a NetStream instance references.
An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream is a sealed class, which means that properties or methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at runtime. Create a subclass of NetStream and define your event handler in the subclass. You can also make the subclass dynamic and add the event handler function to an instance of the subclass.
The associated event listener is triggered after a call to the NetStream.play() method, but before the video playhead has advanced.

The onTextData event object contains one property for each piece of text data.

onXMPData	
Establishes a listener to respond when Flash Player receives information specific to Adobe Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) embedded in the video being played. For information about video file formats supported by Flash Media Server, see the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en" scope="external">www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en.

onXMPData is actually a property of the NetStream.client object. The property is listed in the Events section because it responds to a data event, either when streaming media using Flash Media Server or during FLV file playback. For more information, see the NetStream class description and the NetStream.client property. You cannot use the addEventListener() method, or any other EventDispatcher methods, to listen for or process onMetaData as an event. Define a callback function and attach it to one of the following objects:

The object that the client property of a NetStream instance references.
An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream is a sealed class, which means that properties or methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at runtime. However, you can create a subclass of NetStream and define your event handler in the subclass. You can also make the subclass dynamic and add the event handler function to an instance of the subclass.
The associated event listener is triggered after a call to the NetStream.play() method, but before the video playhead has advanced.

The object passed to the onXMPData() event handling function has one data property, which is a string. The string is generated from a top-level UUID box. (The 128-bit UUID of the top level box is BE7ACFCB-97A9-42E8-9C71-999491E3AFAC.) This top-level UUID box contains exactly one XML document represented as a null-terminated UTF-8 string.

status	
Dispatched when the application attempts to play content encrypted with digital rights management (DRM), by invoking the NetStream.play() method. The value of the status code property will be "DRM.encryptedFLV".

Constructor
new(connection:NetConnection, ?peerID:String)
Creates a stream that you can use to play media files and send data over a NetConnection object.

Parameters:

connection	
A NetConnection object.

peerID	
This optional parameter is available in Flash Player 10 and later, for use with RTMFP connections. (If the value of the NetConnection.protocol property is not "rtmfp", this parameter is ignored.) Use one of the following values: To connect to Flash Media Server, specify NetStream.CONNECT_TO_FMS. To publish directly to peers, specify NetStream.DIRECT_CONNECTIONS. To play directly from a specific peer, specify that peer's identity (see NetConnection.nearID and NetStream.farID). (Flash Player 10.1 or AIR 2 or later) To publish or play a stream in a peer-to-peer multicast group, specify a groupspec string (see the GroupSpecifier class).

In most cases, a groupspec has the potential to use the network uplink on the local system. In this case, the user is asked for permission to use the computer's network resources. If the user allows this use, a NetStream.Connect.Success NetStatusEvent is sent to the NetConnection's event listener. If the user denies permission, a NetStream.Connect.Rejected event is sent. When specifying a groupspec, until a NetStream.Connect.Success event is received, it is an error to use any method of the NetStream object, and an exception is raised.

If you include this parameter in your constructor statement but pass a value of null, the value is set to "connectToFMS".

Throws:

ArgumentError	
The NetConnection instance is not connected.

Variables
read onlybufferLength:Float
The number of seconds of data currently in the buffer. You can use this property with the bufferTime property to estimate how close the buffer is to being full נfor example, to display feedback to a user who is waiting for data to be loaded into the buffer.

bufferTime:Float
Specifies how long to buffer messages before starting to display the stream. The default value is 0.1 (one-tenth of a second). To determine the number of seconds currently in the buffer, use the bufferLength property.

To play a server-side playlist, set bufferTime to at least 1 second. If you experience playback issues, increase the length of bufferTime.

Recorded content To avoid distortion when streaming pre-recorded (not live) content, do not set the value of Netstream.bufferTime to 0. By default, the application uses an input buffer for pre-recorded content that queues the media data and plays the media properly. For pre-recorded content, use the default setting or increase the buffer time.

Live content When streaming live content, set the bufferTime property to 0.

Starting with Flash Player 9.0.115.0, Flash Player no longer clears the buffer when NetStream.pause() is called. Before Flash Player 9.0.115.0, Flash Player waited for the buffer to fill up before resuming playback, which often caused a delay.

For a single pause, the NetStream.bufferLength property has a limit of either 60 seconds or twice the value of NetStream.bufferTime, whichever value is higher. For example, if bufferTime is 20 seconds, Flash Player buffers until NetStream.bufferLength is the higher value of either 202 (40), or 60. In this case it buffers until bufferLength is 60. If bufferTime is 40 seconds, Flash Player buffers until bufferLength is the higher value of 402 (80), or 60. In this case it buffers until bufferLength is 80 seconds.

The bufferLength property also has an absolute limit. If any call to pause() causes bufferLength to increase more than 600 seconds or the value of bufferTime* 2, whichever is higher, Flash Player flushes the buffer and resets bufferLength to 0. For example, if bufferTime is 120 seconds, Flash Player flushes the buffer if bufferLength reaches 600 seconds; if bufferTime is 360 seconds, Flash Player flushes the buffer if bufferLength reaches 720 seconds.

Tip: You can use NetStream.pause() in code to buffer data while viewers are watching a commercial, for example, and then unpause when the main video starts.

For more information about the new pause behavior, see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_smartpause_en" scope="external">http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_smartpause_en</a>.

Flash Media Server. The buffer behavior depends on whether the buffer time is set on a publishing stream or a subscribing stream. For a publishing stream, bufferTime specifies how long the outgoing buffer can grow before the application starts dropping frames. On a high-speed connection, buffer time is not a concern; data is sent almost as quickly as the application can buffer it. On a slow connection, however, there can be a significant difference between how fast the application buffers the data and how fast it is sent to the client.

For a subscribing stream, bufferTime specifies how long to buffer incoming data before starting to display the stream.

When a recorded stream is played, if bufferTime is 0, Flash sets it to a small value (approximately 10 milliseconds). If live streams are later played (for example, from a playlist), this buffer time persists. That is, bufferTime remains nonzero for the stream.

read onlybytesLoaded:Int
The number of bytes of data that have been loaded into the application. You can use this property with the bytesTotal property to estimate how close the buffer is to being full נfor example, to display feedback to a user who is waiting for data to be loaded into the buffer.

read onlybytesTotal:Int
The total size in bytes of the file being loaded into the application.

checkPolicyFile:Bool
Specifies whether the application tries to download a cross-domain policy file from the loaded video file's server before beginning to load the video file. Use this property for progressive video download, and to load files that are outside the calling SWF file's own domain. This property is ignored when you are using RTMP. Set this property to true to call BitmapData.draw() on a video file loaded from a domain outside that of the calling SWF. The BitmapData.draw() method provides pixel-level access to the video. If you call BitmapData.draw() without setting the checkPolicyFile property to true at loading time, you can get a SecurityError exception because the required policy file was not downloaded.

Do not set this property to true unless you want pixel-level access to the video you are loading. Checking for a policy file consumes network bandwidth and can delay the start of your download.

When you call the NetStream.play() method with checkPolicyFile set to true, Flash Player or the AIR runtime must either successfully download a relevant cross-domain policy file or determine that no such policy file exists before it begins downloading. To verify the existence of a policy file, Flash Player or the AIR runtime performs the following actions, in this order:

The application considers policy files that have already been downloaded.
The application tries to download any pending policy files specified in calls to the Security.loadPolicyFile() method.
The application tries to download a policy file from the default location that corresponds to the URL you passed to NetStream.play(), which is /crossdomain.xml on the same server as that URL.
In all cases, Flash Player or Adobe AIR requires that an appropriate policy file exist on the video's server, that it provide access to the object at the URL you passed to play() based on the policy file's location, and that it allow the domain of the calling code's file to access the video, through one or more <allow-access-from> tags.

If you set checkPolicyFile to true, the application waits until the policy file is verified before downloading the video. Wait to perform any pixel-level operations on the video data, such as calling BitmapData.draw(), until you receive onMetaData or NetStatus events from your NetStream object.

If you set checkPolicyFile to true but no relevant policy file is found, you won't receive an error until you perform an operation that requires a policy file, and then the application throws a SecurityError exception.

Be careful with checkPolicyFile if you are downloading a file from a URL that uses server-side HTTP redirects. The application tries to retrieve policy files that correspond to the initial URL that you specify in NetStream.play(). If the final file comes from a different URL because of HTTP redirects, the initially downloaded policy files might not be applicable to the file's final URL, which is the URL that matters in security decisions.

For more information on policy files, see "Website controls (policy files)" in the OpenFL Developer's Guide and the Flash Player Developer Center Topic: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/devnet_security_en" scope="external">Security.

client:Dynamic
Specifies the object on which callback methods are invoked to handle streaming or F4V/FLV file data. The default object is this, the NetStream object being created. If you set the client property to another object, callback methods are invoked on that other object. The NetStream.client object can call the following functions and receive an associated data object: onCuePoint(), onImageData(), onMetaData(), onPlayStatus(), onSeekPoint(), onTextData(), and onXMPData(). To associate the client property with an event handler:

Create an object and assign it to the client property of the NetStream object:
var customClient = new Object();
my_netstream.client = customClient;
Assign a handler function for the desired data event as a property of the client object:
customClient.onImageData = onImageDataHandler;
Write the handler function to receive the data event object, such as:
public function onImageDataHandler(imageData:Object):void {
	trace("imageData length: " + imageData.data.length);
}
When data is passed through the stream or during playback, the data event object (in this case the imageData object) is populated with the data. See the onImageData description, which includes a full example of an object assigned to the client property.

To associate the client property with a subclass:

Create a subclass with a handler function to receive the data event object:
class CustomClient {
	public function onMetaData(info:Object):void {
		trace("metadata: duration=" + info.duration + " framerate=" + info.framerate);
	}
Assign an instance of the subclass to the client property of the NetStream object:
my_netstream.client = new CustomClient();
When data is passed through the stream or during playback, the data event object (in this case the info object) is populated with the data. See the class example at the end of the NetStream class, which shows the assignment of a subclass instance to the client property.

Throws:

TypeError	
The client property must be set to a non-null object.

read onlycurrentFPS:Float
The number of frames per second being displayed. If you are exporting video files to be played back on a number of systems, you can check this value during testing to help you determine how much compression to apply when exporting the file.

read onlyliveDelay:Float
The number of seconds of data in the subscribing stream's buffer in live (unbuffered) mode. This property specifies the current network transmission delay (lag time). This property is intended primarily for use with a server such as Flash Media Server; for more information, see the class description.

You can get the value of this property to roughly gauge the transmission quality of the stream and communicate it to the user.

read onlyobjectEncoding:ObjectEncoding
The object encoding (AMF version) for this NetStream object. The NetStream object inherits its objectEncoding value from the associated NetConnection object. It's important to understand this property if your ActionScript 3.0 SWF file needs to communicate with servers released prior to Flash Player 9. For more information, see the objectEncoding property description in the NetConnection class. The value of this property depends on whether the stream is local or remote. Local streams, where null was passed to the NetConnection.connect() method, return the value of NetConnection.defaultObjectEncoding. Remote streams, where you are connecting to a server, return the object encoding of the connection to the server.

If you try to read this property when not connected, or if you try to change this property, the application throws an exception.

soundTransform:SoundTransform
Controls sound in this NetStream object. For more information, see the SoundTransform class.

read onlytime:Float
The position of the playhead, in seconds. Flash Media Server For a subscribing stream, the number of seconds the stream has been playing. For a publishing stream, the number of seconds the stream has been publishing. This number is accurate to the thousandths decimal place; multiply by 1000 to get the number of milliseconds the stream has been playing.

For a subscribing stream, if the server stops sending data but the stream remains open, the value of the time property stops advancing. When the server begins sending data again, the value continues to advance from the point at which it stopped (when the server stopped sending data).

The value of time continues to advance when the stream switches from one playlist element to another. This property is set to 0 when NetStream.play() is called with reset set to 1 or true, or when NetStream.close() is called.

read onlyvideoCode:Int
Methods
close():Void
Stops playing all data on the stream, sets the time property to 0, and makes the stream available for another use. This method also deletes the local copy of a video file that was downloaded through HTTP. Although the application deletes the local copy of the file that it creates, a copy might persist in the cache directory. If you must completely prevent caching or local storage of the video file, use Flash Media Server. When using Flash Media Server, this method is invoked implicitly when you call NetStream.play() from a publishing stream or NetStream.publish() from a subscribing stream. Please note that:

If close() is called from a publishing stream, the stream stops publishing and the publisher can now use the stream for another purpose. Subscribers no longer receive anything that was being published on the stream, because the stream has stopped publishing.
If close() is called from a subscribing stream, the stream stops playing for the subscriber, and the subscriber can use the stream for another purpose. Other subscribers are not affected.
You can stop a subscribing stream from playing, without closing the stream or changing the stream type by using openfl.net.NetStream.play(false).
dispose():Void
Releases all the resources held by the NetStream object.

The dispose() method is similar to the close method. The main difference between the two methods is that dispose() releases the memory used to display the current video frame. If that frame is currently displayed on screen, the display will go blank. The close() method does not blank the display because it does not release this memory.

pause():Void
Pauses playback of a video stream. Calling this method does nothing if the video is already paused. To resume play after pausing a video, call resume(). To toggle between pause and play (first pausing the video, then resuming), call togglePause(). Starting with Flash Player 9.0.115.0, Flash Player no longer clears the buffer when NetStream.pause() is called. This behavior is called "smart pause". Before Flash Player 9.0.115.0, Flash Player waited for the buffer to fill up before resuming playback, which often caused a delay.

Note: For backwards compatibility, the "NetStream.Buffer.Flush" event (see the NetStatusEvent.info property) still fires, although the server does not flush the buffer.

For a single pause, the NetStream.bufferLength property has a limit of either 60 seconds or twice the value of NetStream.bufferTime, whichever value is higher. For example, if bufferTime is 20 seconds, Flash Player buffers until NetStream.bufferLength is the higher value of either 20~~2 (40), or 60, so in this case it buffers until bufferLength is 60. If bufferTime is 40 seconds, Flash Player buffers until bufferLength is the higher value of 40~~2 (80), or 60, so in this case it buffers until bufferLength is 80 seconds.

The bufferLength property also has an absolute limit. If any call to pause() causes bufferLength to increase more than 600 seconds or the value of bufferTime ~~ 2, whichever is higher, Flash Player flushes the buffer and resets bufferLength to 0. For example, if bufferTime is 120 seconds, Flash Player flushes the buffer if bufferLength reaches 600 seconds; if bufferTime is 360 seconds, Flash Player flushes the buffer if bufferLength reaches 720 seconds.

Tip: You can use NetStream.pause() in code to buffer data while viewers are watching a commercial, for example, and then unpause when the main video starts.

play(url:String, ?p1:Unknown, ?p2:Unknown, ?p3:Unknown, ?p4:Unknown, ?p5:Unknown):Void
Plays a media file from a local directory or a web server; plays a media file or a live stream from Flash Media Server. Dispatches a NetStatusEvent object to report status and error messages. For information about supported codecs and file formats, see the following:

Flash Media Server documentation

Workflow for playing a file or live stream

Create a NetConnection object and call NetConnection.connect(). To play a file from a local directory or web server, pass null.
To play a recorded file or live stream from Flash Media Server, pass the URI of a Flash Media Server application. 2. Call NetConnection.addEventListener(NetStatusEvent.NET_STATUS, netStatusHandler) to listen for NetStatusEvent events. 3. On "NetConnection.Connect.Success", create a NetStream object and pass the NetConnection object to the constructor. 4. Create a Video object and call Video.attachNetStream() and pass the NetStream object. 5. Call NetStream.play(). To play a live stream, pass the stream name passed to the NetStream.publish() method.

To play a recorded file, pass the file name. 6. Call addChild() and pass the Video object to display the video.

Note:To see sample code, scroll to the example at the bottom of this page.

Enable Data Generation Mode

Call play(null) to enable "Data Generation Mode". In this mode, call the appendBytes() method to deliver data to the NetStream. Use Data Generation Mode to stream content over HTTP from the Adobe HTTP Dynamic Streaming Origin Module on an Apache HTTP Server. HTTP Dynamic Streaming lets clients seek quickly to any point in a file. The Open Source Media Framework (OSMF) supports HTTP Dynamic Streaming for vod and live streams. For examples of how to use NetStream Data Generation Mode, download the <a href="http://www.opensourcemediaframework.com" scope="external">OSMF source. For more information about HTTP Dynamic Streaming, see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_http_en" scope="external">HTTP Dynamic Streaming.

When you use this method without Flash Media Server, there are security considerations. A file in the local-trusted or local-with-networking sandbox can load and play a video file from the remote sandbox, but cannot access the remote file's data without explicit permission in the form of a URL policy file. Also, you can prevent a SWF file running in Flash Player from using this method by setting the allowNetworking parameter of the the object and embed tags in the HTML page that contains the SWF content. For more information related to security, see the Flash Player Developer Center Topic: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/devnet_security_en" scope="external">Security.

Throws:

ArgumentError	
At least one parameter must be specified.

Error	
The NetStream Object is invalid. This may be due to a failed NetConnection.

SecurityError	
Local untrusted SWF files cannot communicate with the Internet. You can work around this restriction by reclassifying this SWF file as local-with-networking or trusted.

Events:

status	
Dispatched when attempting to play content encrypted with digital rights management (DRM). The value of the code property is "DRM.encryptedFLV".

resume():Void
Resumes playback of a video stream that is paused. If the video is already playing, calling this method does nothing.

seek(time:Float):Void
Seeks the keyframe (also called an I-frame in the video industry) closest to the specified location. The keyframe is placed at an offset, in seconds, from the beginning of the stream. Video streams are usually encoded with two types of frames, keyframes (or I-frames) and P-frames. A keyframe contains an entire image, while a P-frame is an interim frame that provides additional video information between keyframes. A video stream typically has a keyframe every 10-50 frames.

Flash Media Server has several types of seek behavior: enhanced seeking and smart seeking.

Enhanced seeking

Enhanced seeking is enabled by default. To disable enhanced seeking, on Flash Media Server set the EnhancedSeek element in the Application.xml configuration file to false.

If enhanced seeking is enabled, the server generates a new keyframe at offset based on the previous keyframe and any intervening P-frames. However, generating keyframes creates a high processing load on the server and distortion might occur in the generated keyframe. If the video codec is On2, the keyframe before the seek point and any P-frames between the keyframe and the seek point are sent to the client.

If enhanced seeking is disabled, the server starts streaming from the nearest keyframe. For example, suppose a video has keyframes at 0 seconds and 10 seconds. A seek to 4 seconds causes playback to start at 4 seconds using the keyframe at 0 seconds. The video stays frozen until it reaches the next keyframe at 10 seconds. To get a better seeking experience, you need to reduce the keyframe interval. In normal seek mode, you cannot start the video at a point between the keyframes.

Smart seeking

To enable smart seeking, set NetStream.inBufferSeek to true.

Smart seeking allows Flash Player to seek within an existing back buffer and forward buffer. When smart seeking is disabled, each time seek() is called Flash Player flushes the buffer and requests data from the server. For more information, see NetStream.inBufferSeek.

Seeking in Data Generation Mode

When you call seek() on a NetStream in Data Generation Mode, all bytes passed to appendBytes() are discarded (not placed in the buffer, accumulated in the partial message FIFO, or parsed for seek points) until you call appendBytesAction(NetStreamAppendBytesAction.RESET_BEGIN) or appendBytesAction(NetStreamAppendBytesAction.RESET_SEEK) to reset the parser. For information about Data Generation Mode, see NetStream.play().

Parameters:

offset	
The approximate time value, in seconds, to move to in a video file. With Flash Media Server, if <EnhancedSeek> is set to true in the Application.xml configuration file (which it is by default), the server generates a keyframe at offset. To return to the beginning of the stream, pass 0 for offset. To seek forward from the beginning of the stream, pass the number of seconds to advance. For example, to position the playhead at 15 seconds from the beginning (or the keyframe before 15 seconds), use myStream.seek(15). * To seek relative to the current position, pass NetStream.time + n or NetStream.time - n to seek n seconds forward or backward, respectively, from the current position. For example, to rewind 20 seconds from the current position, use NetStream.seek(NetStream.time - 20).

togglePause():Void
Pauses or resumes playback of a stream. The first time you call this method, it pauses play; the next time, it resumes play. You could use this method to let users pause or resume playback by pressing a single button.
